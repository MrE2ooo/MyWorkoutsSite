MyWorkouts is a dynamic and user-friendly website designed to fetch and display workout data from a custom Workout API. The website allows users to explore various workout routines categorized into Core, Upper Body, and Lower Body. It provides an intuitive interface with buttons to filter and view workouts based on specific categories.

The Workout API, developed by me, serves as the backend for this project. It returns workout data in JSON format, which the website dynamically fetches and displays. This project is a great example of integrating a frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) with a custom API to create an interactive and responsive web application.
